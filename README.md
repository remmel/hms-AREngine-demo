# HUAWEI AR Engine Demo

This if a fork of [hms-AREngine-demo](https://github.com/HMS-Core/hms-AREngine-demo)
I added 2 features :
- Measure : display the distance (depth) of the object to the camera (center depth pixel)
- Recorder : save camera image and depth of x seconds

## Measure

TODO:
- display something to understand where is measured the depth (like coloring the central pixel)

## Recorder

TODO:
- save pose
- save depth to a more reusable format
- understand why it's not possible to save image_preview in a better resolution
